# Theme
My works explore the theme Artificial Intelligence vs Humanity. As a computer science student, I've always been interested in the ethical and legal implications of AI technology, especially when it started to make its way into tasks that have always meant to be done with human creativity such as writing stories, making art, and composing music.
